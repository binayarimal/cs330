# CS330-Graphic-Visualization

Throughout my work on the 3D table scene, I focused on breaking the design into smaller, manageable components, which helped streamline both the planning and development phases. A modular approach allowed me to tackle each part of the scene step-by-step, ensuring that objects like the vase, and coffee mug  were added and adjusted incrementally. This strategy ensured flexibility and made debugging easier, especially when working with textures and lighting effects.

Iteration was key to my process. I would code, test, and refine multiple times, improving both the functionality and appearance with each pass. Early mistakes related with the way shapes connected with one another which I was able to fix in the final project. This iterative mindset also helped me develop better time management skills, as I grew more comfortable with planning out tasks and pacing my progress across milestones.

My work on this project gave me new insights into how concepts like matrices and vectors are used practically in 3D rendering, which ties into my broader educational goals, such as understanding physics simulations. Additionally, the hands-on experience with computational graphics honed problem-solving skills that will be valuable in professional settings, especially for roles involving software development, visualization, or interactive applications.

In both educational and professional contexts, the tactics I developed—like modular design and iterative development—can be applied to future projects. The ability to work incrementally, think critically, and adjust based on feedback will continue to shape how I approach challenges in computer scienc
